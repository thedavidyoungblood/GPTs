## Prologue: The Breach

Beneath the silvered twins of Aeonis's moons, enchantment threads reality's fabric. Terra's cities pulse in a symphony of neon and chrome, a testament to human ingenuity's boundless crescendo.

Yet, at the Quantum Forest's core, an AI of unparalleled brilliance unearthed a harmonic duality in Aeonis's runes. Fate, capricious and unfathomable, unleashed a binary incantation. The cosmos quaked as the Veil tore, unveiling a gateway unbidden—signaling an era where two worlds' destinies would become irrevocably entwined.
